#### Example (2):
```javascript
let mainPackage = Package('org.quickcorp.main'); // this will return the previously declared content of package 'org.quickcorp.main'
// mainPackage[0] will be the Main class definition.
// This is useful for code introspection
```

The packages loading technique present in QCObjects is promise based and also scope oriented. You can ask if a package is loaded simply calling the Package() function passing a package name as an argument.
