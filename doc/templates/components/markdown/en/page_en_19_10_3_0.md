#### Amazon Web Services AWS PIB (Private Amazon Machine Image)


A Private Image lets you build a new AMI by installing AWS Marketplace software on an image you choose from the AMIs available to your AWS account, this allows you to better meet internal specifications for security, management and compliance. As with standard AWS Marketplace AMIs, each Private Image will comprise a subscription for the installed product and have software usage billed via AWS Marketplace.
