#### Class

This is NOT the class definition of ECMAScript 2015 (see [class ECMAScript 2015](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) for reference).

Class is a special function to help you to declare a class in an easier and compatible way. It works cross-browser, and I hope ECMA could adopt something like that in the future. To let javascript not to be confuse about this, [QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev) uses "Class" not "class" (note the Camel Case).
