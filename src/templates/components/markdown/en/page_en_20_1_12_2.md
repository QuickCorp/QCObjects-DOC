#### Usage from config.json:

1.- You need to indicate first that you are using a config.json file by setting the "useConfigService" value to true
```javascript
CONFIG.set('useConfigService',true); // using config.json for custom settings config
```
2.- Once you have set the value above QCObjects will know and look to the next CONFIG settings into the file config.json in the basePath folder of your application.
