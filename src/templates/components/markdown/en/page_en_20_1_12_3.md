#### Usage from an encrypted config.json:

There is also a way to use an encrypted config.json file in order to protect your settings robots that can steal unprotected data from your web application (like API keys web crawlers).

To encrypt your json file go to https://config.qcobjects.dev, put your domain and the config.json content. The tool will encrypt your json and you can copy the encrypted content to insert it in your config.json file. QCObjects will know the data is encrypted and the process to decode the data will be transparent for you.
