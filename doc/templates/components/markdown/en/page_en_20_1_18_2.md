#### Example:

```javascript
Class('MyOwnClass',{
  prop1:'1',
  prop2:2
});

let obj = document.createElement('div').Cast(MyOwnClass);
```

The above code will create a DOM object and Cast it to MyOwnClass. Because of MyOwnClass is a QCObjects type class, obj will now have a prop1 and prop2 properties, and will now be a QCObjects object instance with a body property that is a div element.
