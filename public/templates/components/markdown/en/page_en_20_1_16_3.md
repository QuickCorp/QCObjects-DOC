#### Example (2):
```javascript
Import('org.quickcorp.main',function (){
  console.log('remote import is loaded');
},true);
```
The above code this time is trying to load the same package but using an external path defined by the **remoteImportsPath** setting present in your **CONFIG**

NOTE: In both examples above you have not use or specify the ".js" extension. This it's used by default and can't be changed by security reasons.
