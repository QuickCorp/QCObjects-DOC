#### org.quickcorp.components.TextField

**ButtonField** is a sub-definition of **FormField**, that is commonly used for almost the same purpose of FormField. The main difference between InputField and FormField is that ButtonField has a **```<textarea>```** DOM element as the body of the component by default. And FormField hasn't a pre-defined body.

##### Usage:

```html
<component name="name_of_component" componentClass="TextField"></component>
```
