## Using CDNJS

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qcobjects/[VERSION]/QCObjects.js"></script>
```

Where [VERSION] is the corresponding latest version using numeric notation, example: to use version 2.1.420:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qcobjects/2.1.420/QCObjects.js"></script>
```

You don't need to minify QCObjects, but if you still want to use the minified code, you can do this:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qcobjects/2.1.420/QCObjects.min.js"></script>
```

Again, Change 2.1.420 to the number of the version that you want to use.
